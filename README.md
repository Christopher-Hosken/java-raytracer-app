# Java Raytracer App
Java Raytracer App is a simple program that lets you create and render a 3D scene.

Things to work on:

- OpenGL Viewport
    - FIX ASPECT RATIO: The viewport dimensions are currently width x width. This means that the zoom center is slightly above where it should be.
- Objects
    - MAKE OBJECTS SELECTABLE: Use old code to select objects. 
    - CREATE HANDLES: when object selected, make transform handles (translate, rotate, scale)
    - IMPORT OBJ: Get an OBJ importer working.
    - GENERATE SPHERE: Get the sphere generator working.
- Rendering 
    - READ CURRENT SCENE: Get OpenGL scene data and prepare for rendering.
    - RENDER: get rendering working and output to specified folder.
- Eextra
    - LOAD SCENE: Loading and saving scenes.

# Getting Started

### Installation
The app should be able to run straight out of the box. However you will need Java installed.
